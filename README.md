# 🌐 Network Engineering & Network Security Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Engineering & Network Security Portfolio, a hands-on collection of labs and projects 
demonstrating real-world enterprise configurations across routing, switching, firewalls, VPNs, and secure 
network design. As a Senior Network Engineer with over a decade of experience, I’m expanding deeper into 
Network Security and Cyber Defense — bridging traditional infrastructure with modern security frameworks 
and technologies. This repository is organized into distinct domains representing key focus areas in my 
professional journey:
