# 🌐 Network Engineering & Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my **Network Engineering & Cybersecurity Portfolio**, a hands-on collection of labs and projects demonstrating real-world scenarios across **routing, switching, firewall configuration, VPN design, and enterprise cybersecurity practices**.

As a **Senior Network Engineer** with over a decade of experience, I’m expanding into **Cybersecurity and Network Defense** — bridging traditional networking with modern security frameworks and technologies.

This repository is organized into distinct domains representing core skill areas:  

| 📁 **Category** | 💡 **Focus Area** | 🔗 **Link** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| **Network Security** | Palo Alto Networks, Firewalls, VPNs, NAT, and User-ID Integrations. | [Explore →](./network-security/) |
| **Cybersecurity** | Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC), threat analysis, and SOC practices. | [Explore →](./cybersecurity/) |
| **Routing & Switching** | Cisco networking, VLANs, Spanning Tree, EIGRP, OSPF, and advanced Layer 2/3 concepts. | [Explore →](./routing-switching/) |
