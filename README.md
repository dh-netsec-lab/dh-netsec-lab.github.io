#Network Engineering & Network Security Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Engineering & Network Security Portfolio — a hands-on collection of labs and projects demonstrating real-world enterprise configurations in routing, switching, firewalls, VPNs, and secure network design. Building on years of professional experience, I’m continuously expanding into Network Security and Cyber Defense, bridging traditional infrastructure with modern security frameworks. These labs are a work in progress and will be regularly updated to reflect new challenges, tools, and best practices.
