# 🌐 Network Engineering & Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my **Network Engineering & Cybersecurity Portfolio**, a hands-on collection of labs and projects demonstrating real-world scenarios across **routing, switching, firewall configuration, VPN design, and enterprise cybersecurity practices**.

As a **Senior Network Engineer** with over a decade of experience, I’m expanding into **Cybersecurity and Network Defense** — bridging traditional networking with modern security frameworks and technologies.

This repository is organized into distinct domains representing core skill areas:  

## 📂 Portfolio Categories

| 📁 **Category** | 💡 **Focus Area** | 🔗 **Explore** |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Network Security** | Palo Alto Networks, Firewalls, VPNs, NAT, and User-ID Integrations — enterprise-grade security labs demonstrating segmentation, encryption, and identity-based access control. | [Explore →](./network-security/) |
| **Cybersecurity** | Governance, Risk Management, and Compliance (GRC), Incident Response, Threat Analysis, and SOC operational concepts — bridging security engineering with defensive strategy. | [Explore →](./cybersecurity/) |
| **Networking** | Routing, Switching, VLANs, Spanning Tree, OSPF, and advanced Layer 2/3 designs — showcasing a strong Cisco and core networking foundation. | [Explore →](./networking/) |
