# Network Engineering and Network Security Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Engineering and Network Security Portfolio, a collection of labs and projects demonstrating real-world enterprise configurations across routing, switching, firewalls, VPNs, and secure network design.

As a Senior Network Engineer with over a decade of experience, I’m expanding deeper into Network Security and Cyber Defense — bridging traditional infrastructure with modern security frameworks and technologies.

This repository is organized into distinct domains representing key focus areas in my professional journey.

## Portfolio Categories

| Category | Focus Area | Explore |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Network Security | Palo Alto Networks, Firewalls, VPNs, NAT, and User-ID Integrations — enterprise-grade labs demonstrating segmentation, encryption, and access control. | [Explore](./network-security/) |
| Networking | Routing, Switching, VLANs, Spanning Tree, OSPF, and advanced Layer 2/3 designs — showcasing a strong Cisco and infrastructure foundation. | [Explore](./networking/) |
| Cybersecurity (in progress) | Future expansion into Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC), Incident Response, and SOC fundamentals. | [Explore](./cybersecurity/) |

## Portfolio Objectives

- Demonstrate applied expertise in network and firewall technologies  
- Showcase real-world lab implementations with clear documentation  
- Bridge core networking with evolving security engineering practices  
- Provide detailed, visual, and reproducible examples for hiring managers and peers

## Certifications and Goals

- CompTIA Security+  
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect  
- Cisco CCNA / CCNP (expired)  
- Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall Engineer (in progress)  
- CISSP (target completion: February 2026)

## Featured Projects

Each project folder includes:
- Configuration steps and screenshots  
- Topology diagrams  
- Verification outputs  
- Learning objectives and summaries  

Example: [Overlapping Subnets VPN Lab](./network-security/palo-alto-overlapping-subnet-lab/) — demonstrates how to build a site-to-site VPN between identical subnets using NAT translation.
