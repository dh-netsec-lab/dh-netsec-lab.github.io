# 🌐 Network Engineering & Network Security Portfolio

Welcome to my Network Engineering & Network Security Portfolio, a hands-on collection of labs and projects 
demonstrating real-world enterprise configurations across routing, switching, firewalls, VPNs, and secure 
network design. As a Senior Network Engineer with over a decade of experience, I’m expanding deeper into 
Network Security and Cyber Defense — bridging traditional infrastructure with modern security frameworks 
and technologies. This repository is organized into distinct domains representing key focus areas in my 
professional journey:

---

| 📁 **Category** | 💡 **Focus Area** | 🔗 **Explore** |
|------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Network Security** | Vendors such as Palo Alto Networks and Fortinet covering skills such as site-to-site VPN, overlapping subnets, User-ID, SSL decryption, and more. | [Explore →](./network-security/index.md) |
| **Networking (in progress)** | Labs and exercises covering Routing, Switching, BGP, OSPF, and advanced Layer2/3 infrastructure design. | Explore → |
| **Cybersecurity (in progress)** | Future expansion into Governance, Risk Management, Compliance (GRC), Incident Response, and SOC fundamentals. | Explore → |
